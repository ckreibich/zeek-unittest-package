Corelight::UnitTest
=================================

A Zeek package with a plugin that includes experimental unit test support.
This only works with a custom Zeek build in this branch:

https://github.com/zeek/zeek/pull/new/topic/christian/doctest-in-packages

To see the unit tests defind in this package, take a look at src/Plugin.cc

For configure-level tweaks, see configure.plugin. CMakeLists.txt duplicates the
`ENABLE_ZEEK_UNIT_TESTS` logic also found in Zeek.
